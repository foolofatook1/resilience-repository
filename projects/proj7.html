<h5 style="margin-top: -1px;">Anthropomorphization of the Panda</h5>
<p>
On the World Wildlife Fund’s website page dedicated to the giant panda, there is an option for viewers to “adopt a panda.” Instead of asking readers to “donate,” the creators of the site used terminology that is primarily associated with a solely parental, human-centered, action. Forging a connection between viewers and the species, this further perpetuates the idea that the animals resemble human children, thus garnering stronger sympathy and support for the species. 
</p><p>
Another way the giant panda is presented through an anthropomorphic lens is through the existence of “panda porn,” which conservationists use in an attempt to facilitate breeding in captive populations (BBC). “Panda porn” supports the portrayal of the panda as a human-like species with which humans can identify. 
</p><p>
Put simply, the panda is so adored and the species’ protection is supported so much because “they remind us of ourselves” (BBC). 
</p>
<h5>Cuteness of the Panda</h5>
<p>
The black markings around pandas’ eyes make them appear bigger, and in addition to this, the animals also have other larger features, like their heads, which humans associate with children. Essentially, we think pandas are cute, and that they resemble baby humans. A parental instinct takes over that subconsciously makes us want to “care for them” (BBC). Looking at something cute and childlike stimulates activity in the middle part of the orbital frontal cortex of the brain, which evokes “pleasure and positive emotion” in the individual (Schneider). This in turn “triggers nurturing responses from adults” (Schneider). 
</p><p>
There are several “formal properties associated with cuteness” that the panda exemplifies: compactness, softness, and simplicity (Ngai 2005: 816). In possessing these traits, pandas are consequently labelled as being “helpless” and as creatures in dire need of human care (Ngai 2005: 816). 
</p>
<h5>Captive Life</h5>
<p>
What is it like for a panda to live in captivity? Panda caretaker Nicole MacCorkle logged her “Day in the Life of a Giant Panda Keeper,” in which she documents how she cares for Mei Xiang, Tian Tian, and Bei Bei at the Smithsonian’s National Zoo. 
</p><p>
The caretakers have tactics they use in order to keep the pandas physically and mentally active: through the use of positive reinforcement and operant conditioning, the animals have the “opportunity to voluntarily participate in their own care” (MacCorkle). Nicole notes that caretakers never go into the same enclosure space as adult giant pandas, but instead interact with them through mesh screens.
</p><p>
Throughout the day, the pandas have the agency to move back and forth from their inside enclosure and their outside space. Their days are spent eating, sleeping, and doing enrichment activities. However, by 3:00 PM, the pandas are moved inside for the night. 
</p>
<h5>Symbolism</h5>
<p>
Giant pandas are political, cultural, and conservation symbols. The species is significant in Chinese culture; they are seen as “warriors” because of the way they forage for food and live in harsh mountain climates (Wang). They are also seen as symbols of peace in China because they are gentle and are rarely violent. The black and white coloring of the panda is like a “physical representation of Yin and Yang,” and this balance is seen to evoke “harmony and peace” (Wang). 
</p><p>
The species has also become a political symbol for China. If the country wants to loan out a panda to a zoo in another country, political negotiations could take years. The species is so tied with China that Chinese officials sometimes get worried that they will get criticized if something goes wrong in conservation efforts. 
</p><p>
The panda became a symbol for the conservation movement in the 1960s. It has since been used as the World Wildlife Fund’s logo, as it is simple, yet very recognizable and can garner lots of public support. 
</p>
<h5>Public Funding</h5>
<p>
Pandas garner so much public support because they are “charismatic megafauna,” but many conservationists say they are “wastes of conservation money,” and also point out that popular species like the panda take attention away from other more endangered species like invertebrates (Buchen). The giant panda’s status is listed as “vulnerable” (WWF), whereas many other less popular species, that require more public support, are listed as endangered or critically endangered.
</p><p>
Many also believe panda conservation efforts, like captive breeding, are not worth it, and that all the public funding is unnecessary, because there isn’t enough habitat left in the wild to support released populations. However, they still receive millions of dollars worth of support from the public. Conservationists state that this money would be more beneficial if it was put towards conserving habitat instead of captive breeding.
